# uneviedefourmi (an ant's life)
Exploration of nodal structures (pathing?) through an anthill example.

## Analysis:

1. **Graph Structure**: The anthill is essentially a graph where:
   - Nodes are rooms (entrance hall Sv, dormitory Sd, and intermediate rooms)
   - Edges are tunnels between rooms

2. **Constraints**:
   - All ants start from the entrance hall
   - Each intermediate room can only contain one ant at a time (unless specified otherwise)
   - An ant can only enter a room if it's empty or if its only occupant is leaving
   - Tunnels are crossed instantly

3. **Objective**:
   - Move all ants to the dormitory in minimum steps

## Algorithmic Approach

To solve this problem:

1. Represent the anthill as a graph
2. Use a shortest path algorithm (like BFS) to determine optimal paths
3. Simulate ant movement while respecting constraints
4. Optimize the order of ant movements
